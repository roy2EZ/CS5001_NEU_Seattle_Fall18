## Program:
##### P1/2: string_process.py
good work!
-Documentation: no testing, pytest isn't required but there should be some testing beyond Examples, especially with such nice modular functions.

##### P3: upc.py
Nice work!
-Documentation: tests are provided per the problem specifications, but you should really have separate tests and examples. Tests are good and thorough though

##### P4: sportsball.py
-Documentation: No design recipes.
Good organization of functions!
