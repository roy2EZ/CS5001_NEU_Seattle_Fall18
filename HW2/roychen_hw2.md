_total: 100/100_

### Program:
##### P1:
Looks great!
A tip: Casting the string as a list on line 22 is unnecessary for your code to work exactly as it is, since you can iterate over strings in python in the same way you would a list.

-Documentation: Examples and testing should be separate, but examples are very thorough

##### P2:
Nice implementation. Storing the win and lose combinations as a list is clever.

-Readability: imports should be at the top of the file

##### P3:
-Documentation: Examples and testing should be separate, but examples are very thorough

-Readability: Literals on lines 39, 54, and 55 should be constants

-Program Correctness: 35, 13, wed, Y => $9.25, when it should be $8.25
  line 74 you should subtract, not add the weather_extra into your result
