Design flow for Homework 6:
1.Draw the board
2.Prompt user to choose a color
3.Draw first four tiles
4.Prompt user to enter column and row numbers to set the position of his tile

Pseudocode:

# Part 1: Draw the board

# 1.1: Draw the board using stater code from teacher 
function draw_board(n): 
    create the turtle to draw the board
    set line color and fill color 
    move the turtle to the bottom left corner

# 1.2 My adding: write coordinates around the board
# Purpose: user can easily see the column and row number for entering the tile
# Note: the board is n column * n row, each block's side length as SQUARE = 50
# I use n=4 for example above.

# 1.2.1 write column numbers at bottom of the board
for each i in 1 to 4:
    set the position at the bottom outside of "column 1 row 1" (left bottom corner)
    write number 1 to 4 from left to right, interval = SQUARE 

# 1.2.2 write column numbers at bottom of the board        
for j in range(n):
    set the position at left outside of "column 1 row 1" (left bottom corner)
    write number 1 to 4 from bottom to top, interval = SQUARE 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1.3 draw_lines function will be used in draw_board 
function draw_lines(turt,n):
    draw lines, interval = SQUARE	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2: initialization tiles and related functions for future design use 

# 2.1 init_position_dict function:
# After draw the n*n board, I want to create a dictionary to restore all positions
# the elements in that dictionary will be as {1:[1,1], 2:[1,2] ... 16:[4,4]} (when n=4)
# which means there are totally 16 positions with ite column and row number as value
# This is for future use in Homework 7, pseudocode not design yet.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.2 After user choose color, set the first four tiles to start the game
# This function will call draw_tile function at four specific initial positions
# For example, if user color is black and n=4: 
# we draw black tile at column 2 row 2, and column 3 row 3
# we draw white tile at column 3 row 2, and column 2 row 3
function init_first_four_tiles(n=4,color):
    for x in [2,3]:
        for y in [2,3]:
            draw_tile(4,x,y,color)
            color_number add 1 to change color
        color_number add 1 to change color
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.3 define draw_tile function for drawing the tile at position row x column y 
function draw_tile(n,x,y,color_number):
    set position at column y row x
    fill color with current color_number's color
    draw a circle, radius = SQUARE/2
    end fill
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 3: create main function to run the game 
# 3.1 Prompt user to enter the size of board n, and n should be even number.
# Note: I use Exception handling until get valid input of n
function main()
while True:
    try:
	user input n
        if n is not even number
            raise ValueError
    except ValueError:
        print guidance to let user input even number
        continue
    else:
        break
# 3.2 draw the n*n board using user input n 
draw_board(n)
# 3.3 iniinitialize a dictionary of all legal positions for future use
init_position_dict(n) 
# 3.4 prompt user to choose a color of his tile
# Note: I use Exception handling until get valid input of color_number
while True:
    try:
        user input color_number, 1 for black, 2 for white
        if color_number not in [1,2]:
            raise ValueError
    except ValueError:
        print guidance to let user input 1 or 2
        continue
    else:
        break
# 3.5 initialize the first four tiles 
init_first_four_tiles(n,color_number)
# 3.6 let user input column number "y" of expected tile position
# the first while loop is for future use to stop the loop to exit game
while True:
    # following while loop is for Exception handling of y
    while True:
        try:
            user input y
            if y < 1 or y > n:
                raise ValueError
        except ValueError:
            print guidance to let user input valid y
            continue
        else:
            break 
# 3.7 let user input row number "x" of expected tile position
    # following while loop is for Exception handling of y    
    while True:
        try:
            user input x
            if x < 1 or x > n:
                raise ValueError
        except ValueError:
            print guidance to let user input valid x
            continue
        else:
            break
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 4: run the main() function
main()
turtle.done()
